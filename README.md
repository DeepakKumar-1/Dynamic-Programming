# Dynamic-Programming

* Dynamic Programming (DP) is an algorithmic technique for solving a problem by recursively breaking it down into simpler subproblems and using the fact that the optimal solution to the overall problem depends upon the optimal solution to itâ€™s individual subproblems.
* Conditions :  
 1. Overlapping Subproblems
 2. Optimal Substructure
